# Sustainability Chatbot( AI-Driven PDF Q&A Assistant) using Grok and Perplexity



## 🚀 Objective

The **PDF ChatBot** project lets users ask questions about the content of their PDF files through a friendly chat interface. It leverages *state-of-the-art AI* to provide accurate, context-aware answers, pointing to the exact page and source document.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Key Components:**

- **Flask Web Server:** Serves the front-end (landing & chat pages), handles PDF uploads, and manages user Q&A interactions.
- **PDF Processing:** Uses `PDFPlumberLoader` to extract text from PDFs uploaded to `static/uploads`.
- **Semantic Chunking:** Documents are split using *SemanticChunker* for meaningful context windows.
- **Embeddings:** All content is embedded with `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic search.
- **FAISS Vector Store:** Stores embeddings to allow *fast similarity search*. Loads from disk or builds as needed.
- **Retriever:** Efficient nearest-neighbor search for relevant context chunks.
- **LLM Backend:** Answers are generated by the `ChatPerplexity/ChatxAI`(Use for both cases) , ensuring high-quality research responses.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Custom prompts ensure the bot stays grounded and doesn't hallucinate answers.

## 🏁 Quickstart
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**
3. 
3. **Set up environment:**

- Place your PDFs in the `static/uploads` directory.
